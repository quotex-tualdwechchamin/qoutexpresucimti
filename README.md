## Why Use the Quotex Authentication App?

The Quotex authentication app provides an extra layer of security for
your trading account. It uses two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect
your account from unauthorized access. 2FA requires you to enter a
one-time password (OTP) in addition to your password when you log in to
your account. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain
access to your account, even if they have your password.
